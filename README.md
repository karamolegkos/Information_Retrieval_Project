# Information_Retrieval_Project

This repository is a project made by me for the subject named "Information Retrieval" @ University of Piraeus. The project is a "mini" Search Engine, able to answear which documents have some words that are searched in the console using BOOLE algebra. It can also answear to queries having wild cards like "hel*" or "*rce" etc.

It consist the directories below:
- data: Some data that I made for testing my Search Engine.
- search-engine: The files needed to run the application.

To Run the console application the user can eather run the main java file below:
```
search-engine\java-code\Runner.java
```
Or run the jar file from the path below:
```
search-engine\jar-file\e17065.jar
```
